## The Project

 This Shiny application is part of the final project of the Developing Data Products course, where we cover the basics of data product creation using Shiny, R and interactive graphics packages.
 part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization at coursera.org.

 This application analyzes the Mtcars data in the R dataset package. The data are from Motor Trend magazine in the USA of 1974 and comprise the fuel consumption and ten characteristics of the design and performance of the car for 32 cars.

 Our mission here is to show through the cars table, the option to be able to view through a faster selection.

 In a table is composed of 234 records, divided into several makes and models of cars, as well as their characteristics.
